## Title:
ENHANCING SPEECH IN REAL-TIME: USING DENSE NEURAL NETWORKS WITH DILATED CONVOLUTIONS AND SQUEEZED TEMPORAL CONVOLUTIONAL MODULES IN THE TIME DOMAIN.
### Abstract:
we present a fully convolutional neural network for enhancing real-time speech in the time domain. Skip connections are included in the architecture of the proposed encoder-decoder network. The layers in the decoder and encoder are down the lined by densely connected blocks (DCB) made of causal and dilated convolutions. These dilated convolutions facilitate the aggregation of contextual information across multiple resolutions. The network is ideal for real-time applications due to the causal convolutions' utilization of information inflow prevention from subsequent frames. Additionally, we propose employing up sampling in the decoder with sub-pixel convolutional layers. We also proposed employing a Squeezed temporal convolutional network (STCNs) after every dense block in encoder and decoder. To train the model, a loss function consisting of two components is also utilized: a loss in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The model performs better than the time-domain loss using the proposed loss function. According to experimental outcomes, the suggested model greatly surpasses previous state-of-the-art models in quality scores as well as objective intelligibility in real-time scenarios.
